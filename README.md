# Catstone Frontend - *Click **[here](https://github.com/Philomena-Kelly/Catstone-backend)** for backend.*

> *Brought to you by the nostalgia from the heyday of online virtual pet sites and games, Catstone lets you create your very own pet cat! You can choose your cat's color and location, and they will change outfits depending on the weather.*
> 
> *Users can visit their friends cats, leave treats, and even add comments back and forth to eachother. Catstone is aimed to be a simple, carefree experience to help unwind and relive those memories.*

This webapp was created for the final Captstone project of Ada Developers Academy. It was developed in under a month using the MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS. 

Catstone makes use of the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to change the cats' "outfits". The remaining API routes that connect to MongoDB are located in the backend repo.

Catstone is currently *incomplete* and not currently available for the public, but stay tuned for updates!

## Future Plans:
* Incorporating Passport to create a user authentication system.
* Updating the treats to have different options.
* "Friends" lists.
* Messaging system.
* Deployment.
